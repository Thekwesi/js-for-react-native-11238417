11238417 Task 1 contains implements the function processArray processArray takes the array numbers Using the forEach method, it iterates through the each element in the array, if it is meets the condition in the if statement, it squares the number. Otherwise it triples the number. Finally the results are rertured.

Task 2 implements the function formatArrayStrings and takes two arrays, numbers and strings. It then first checks if the two arrays are of the same length using an if statement. If they aren't, it gives an error alert that the arrays are not of the same length. Otherwise it uses a for loop to make sure the code does not run past index 9. Then an if statement is used to ensure that if the number is even, its corresponding index in the string array is capitalized. Otherwise it is made lowercase.

Task 3 implements the function createUserProfiles. It creates an object representing a user profile. The object contains three properties: id, originalName, and modifiedName. id is assigned a value based on the current index (starting from 1). originalName is assigned the value from the names array at the current index. modifiedName is assigned the value from the modifiedNames array at the same index. Each constructed user profile object is then pushed into the userProfiles array. Return Result: After the loop completes, the function returns the userProfiles array, which now contains all the user profile objects.
